# DISTANCE-BETWEEN-TWO-POINTS

## AIM:

To write a python program to find the distance two 2 points

## ALGORITHM:

### Step 1:

Import the math module to use the built-in functions for calculation.

### Step 2:

Get the 2 points from the user.

### Step 3:

Substitute the values in the distance formula <br>

### Step 4:

Print the distance.

### Step 5:

End the program

### PROGRAM:

```python
# Program to find the distance of the bridge from one point to another point.

# RegisterNumber : 212223230195
x1=int(10)
y1=int(6)
x2=int(4)
y2=int(2)
d2=(x2-x1)*(x2-x1)+(y2-y1)*(y2-y1)
d=d2**0.5
print(round(d,2))
```

### OUTPUT:

### RESULT:

Thus the program to find the distance between two points is written and verified using python programming.
